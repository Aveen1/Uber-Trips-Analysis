# Uber-Trips-Analysis

Uber travels can be examined to identify a number of patterns, including the busiest hour for the service and the days with the most and least trips. 
The data I'm using here is derived from Uber trips from New York, a city with a big residential population and an extremely intricate transportation system.

Information from 14.3 million pickups from January to June 2015 and 4.5 million pickups in New York City from April to September are included in the dataset.
